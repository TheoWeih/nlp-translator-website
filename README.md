# nlp-translator-website

This is a collaborative project from 
Julian Fong (B.Sc. Statistics University of Toronto) and 
Theo Weihprachtitzky (B.Sc. Computer Science Technical University of Darmstadt).

The goal is to create a website which inputs a text in a foreign language (yet to be decided, might be mandarin, korean or german) and translates it into english with a recommendation on which words or symbols to learn first.

For this there will be a frontend (React with Material UI), backend (Flask) with a nlp module to translate the text (BERT or GPT-J) or a self written one.
